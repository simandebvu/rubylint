### About RubyLint
**_Rubylint_** is a linter for Ruby Style Guide specifications, which:

- Makes Ruby Code Readable
- Checks compliance
- Delivers early feedback for Ruby Developers
- Provides best practices and advices

## Usage

The **_Rubylint_** does basic syntax checking, as well as applying a set of rules to the code and throws back an error if bad syntax is found. Inspired by the ruby style guide.
The throwback error is being printed out indicating the line and column of the specific syntax issue.

**Examples**
- Spacing, not enough spacing between line items.
- Class Usage, more than one class per file.
- Line Format, unnecessary charater **';'**
- Line length error, recommended line length is 60.
