## Usage

The **_Rubylint_** does basic syntax checking, as well as applying a set of rules to the code and throws back an error if bad syntax is found. Inspired by the ruby style guide.
The throwback error is being printed out indicating the line and column of the specific syntax issue.

**Examples**
- Spacing, not enough spacing between line items.
- Class Usage, more than one class per file.
- Line Format, unnecessary charater **';'**
- Line length error, recommended line length is 60.

To test out **Rubylint** you need to:
* have **Ruby** installed on your computer
* [download](https://github.com/simandebvu/rubylint/archive/develop.zip) or clone this repo:

  git@github.com:simandebvu/rubylint.git
  ```
  - Clone with HTTPS:
  ```

  ```
* Navigate to root directory of the repo and run:
```
$ bin/main path_to_file.rb (path_to_file being the file you want to check for linters)
```
